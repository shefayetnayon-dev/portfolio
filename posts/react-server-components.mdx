# The Paradigm Shift

React Server Components (RSC) allow you to write UI that can be rendered on the server. This sounds simple, but it fundamentally changes how we build React apps.

## The "Waterflow" Problem

In traditional React, we often had network waterfalls.

1. App mounts
2. Header fetches user
3. Dashboard fetches stats

With RSC, we can fetch everything in parallel on the server before sending HTML to the client.

## Client Components

Use `"use client"` at the top of a file to mark it as a Client Component. This is required for:
- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- Event listeners (`onClick`)

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

## Summary

RSC is not just for performance; it's a better composition model for data-heavy applications.
