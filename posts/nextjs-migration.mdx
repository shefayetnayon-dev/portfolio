# Introduction

Next.js 14 brings a stable version of Server Actions, partial prerendering, and significant performance upgrades. In this guide, we'll walk through migrating a large-scale application from Next.js 13 pages router to the new App Router.

## Why Migrate?

1. **Performance**: Server Components reduce client-side bundle size.
2. **DX**: Simplified data fetching with `await` in React components.
3. **Simplicity**: No more `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` boilerplate.

```tsx
// Before (Pages Router)
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  return { props: { data } }
}

// After (App Router)
async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  return <main>{data.title}</main>
}
```

## Step 1: Upgrading Dependencies

First, ensure you have the latest version of Next.js, React, and React DOM.

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

## Step 2: caching and Revalidating

Next.js 14 has improved caching heuristics. By default, `fetch` requests are cached indefinitely.

> Use `revalidatePath` to purge cache on-demand.

## Conclusion

The migration is worth the effort for the long-term maintainability and performance benefits.
