# Taming the Utility Beast

Tailwind CSS is amazing, but your HTML can quickly look like a war zone. Here are 5 tips to keep your codebase clean.

## 1. The `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` Combo

Use a utility function implementation like `cn()` to merge classes conditionally without conflicts.

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```

## 2. Plugins are your friend

Don't reinvent the wheel. Use `tailwindcss-animate` for easy animations and `@tailwindcss/typography` for beautiful markdown rendering (like this blog!).

## 3. Custom Color Palettes

Define your colors in `tailwind.config.ts` using HSL variables for instant dark mode support.

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: "hsl(var(--primary))",
    }
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Mastering the configuration is the key to unlocking Tailwind's full potential.
